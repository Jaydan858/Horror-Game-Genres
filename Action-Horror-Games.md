## Plot Setup
* Six years after Raccoon City: Leon S. Kennedy, now a federal agent, is still haunted by the events of the Raccoon City outbreak
* Presidential daughter abducted: Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, has been kidnapped and is believed to be in a remote village in Spain
* A mysterious cult: Leon is dispatched to the village, where he discovers a fanatical cult that worships a powerful parasitic organism


## Plot
- In Resident Evil 4, federal agent Leon S. Kennedy is sent to a remote part of Spain to rescue the U.S. President's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a sinister Los Illuminados cult. The cult uses a parasitic organism called the Las Plagas, which infects its host, to control villagers and pursue their own biological weapon agenda. Leon must fight through the infected villagers, the cult's leaders, and the mysterious spy Ada Wong to save Ashley and escape the isolated region. 

## Gameplay
Resident Evil 4 gameplay involves exploring dangerous locations to rescue the President's daughter, engaging in intense third-person combat against infected villagers, managing limited resources like ammo and healing items, and solving environmental puzzles. Key mechanics include using weapons and melee to conserve ammo, exploiting enemy weaknesses with targeted shots, utilizing a merchant to upgrade gear, and completing side quests for rewards. Both the classic 2005 game and the 2023 Remake feature over-the-shoulder aiming, but the Remake adds fluid movement, quicker action, and an improved melee system with a persistent knife.  
Core Gameplay Loop

Enemy Encounters: Face large groups of enemies and challenging boss fights, requiring careful movement and strategy. 
Key Figures & Items
Leon S. Kennedy: The protagonist, a seasoned government agent seeking to rescue the President's daughter.

Game Structure
## Why Resident Evil 4 Is Considered An Action Horror Game
- Resident Evil 4 is considered action horror because it blends tense, unsettling horror elements with a strong emphasis on combat and action, such as its over-the-shoulder camera, laser sight for precise targeting, context-sensitive combat moves, and more abundant resources compared to earlier games in the series. While it contains frightening moments and suspenseful encounters, the shift in gameplay focus toward aggressive, tactical shooting and melee combat differentiates it from traditional survival horror.
