# Plot
- In Silent Hill 2, the story revolves around James Sunderland, who travels to the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, asking him to meet her there. Upon arrival, James is plunged into a personal hellscape where horrifying monsters and unsettling environments serve as manifestations of his own suppressed guilt, shame, and despair over the recent death of his wife. He encounters other troubled souls, including Maria, a woman who resembles Mary, and the tormenting Pyramid Head. The game culminates in James confronting his repressed trauma and the horrifying truth of his actions: he suffocated Mary out of resentment during her prolonged illness, not as an act of mercy. The game features multiple endings, each revealing a different aspect of James's journey through grief and his ultimate fate, which could be suicide, a repeat of the cycle, or a fragile peace.
